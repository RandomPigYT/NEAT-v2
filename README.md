# NEAT-v2

This is a simple, header-only implementation of NEAT (Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies).

## Usage

### As Implementation

```   
    #define NEAT_H_IMPLEMENTATION
    #include "NEAT.h"
```

### As Header

```   
    #include "NEAT.h"
```

## Visalisation Header

An optional visualisation header has also been provided. This uses raylib to draw a model of the trained neural network. 
All the code necessary for visualisation is present in the "NEAT-Visualise.h" header. It can be included much in the same way as the main header.

## Disclaimer

I've written this library for purely educational purposes, and so, it is by no means production grade. 
Use at your own risk.
